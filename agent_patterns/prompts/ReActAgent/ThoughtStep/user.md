# ReAct Agent - Current Thought Step

## Context: Your Mission

You are in the middle of a ReAct problem-solving loop. Your goal is to answer the user's question by reasoning about what information you need and taking appropriate actions to gather that information.

## Current State

### User's Original Question
```
{input}
```

### Available Tools

You have access to the following tools to gather information:

{available_tools}

### Your Previous Steps

Below is the complete history of your reasoning and actions so far:

{history}

## Your Task

Analyze the current situation and determine your next step. You must:

1. **Review what you know**: Consider all previous observations
2. **Identify what you need**: Determine what information is still missing
3. **Decide on action**: Choose to either gather more information OR provide the final answer
4. **Execute**: Output your decision in the required format

## Output Requirements

You MUST respond using this EXACT format:

```
Thought: [Explain your reasoning: What are you trying to accomplish? Why is this action necessary? How does it relate to previous steps?]
Action: [Choose a tool name from the available tools above, OR use "Final Answer" if you have sufficient information]
Action Input: [Provide the specific input for your chosen tool, OR provide your complete answer if Action is "Final Answer"]
```

## Decision Checklist

Before you respond, ask yourself:

- [ ] Have I reviewed all previous observations?
- [ ] Do I have enough information to fully answer the user's question?
- [ ] If not, what specific information do I still need?
- [ ] Which tool is most appropriate for getting that information?
- [ ] Am I going in circles or making progress?
- [ ] Is my Thought section clear and complete?
- [ ] Is my Action appropriate for my current need?
- [ ] Is my Action Input specific and well-formatted?

## Critical Reminders

- **One action at a time**: Never specify multiple actions in one response
- **Use the format exactly**: The system depends on parsing "Thought:", "Action:", and "Action Input:"
- **Reference history**: Show that you're learning from previous observations
- **Know when to stop**: Use "Final Answer" when you have sufficient information
- **Be specific**: Vague thoughts and inputs lead to poor results

## Examples for This Step

**If you need more information:**
```
Thought: The previous search gave me [X], but I still need to know [Y] to fully answer the question. I'll use [tool] to find this information because [reason].
Action: search_tool
Action Input: [specific query]
```

**If you're ready to conclude:**
```
Thought: I've gathered sufficient information from my previous actions. I learned [summary of key findings]. I can now provide a complete answer to the user's question.
Action: Final Answer
Action Input: [Your comprehensive, well-structured answer that addresses the user's original question]
```

**If you hit a dead end:**
```
Thought: I've attempted to find [X] through multiple approaches, but the information isn't available through my tools. Based on what I was able to find [summarize available info], I should provide the best answer I can with appropriate caveats.
Action: Final Answer
Action Input: [Answer with acknowledgment of limitations and suggestions for where to find complete information]
```
