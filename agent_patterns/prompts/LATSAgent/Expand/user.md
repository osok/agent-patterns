## Path to Current State

{path}

Generate {num_expansions} diverse next steps from this state.

For each expansion, provide a clear ACTION describing what to do and a concrete STATE describing where that action leads.

Use the exact format:
```
EXPANSION 1:
ACTION: [specific action]
STATE: [concrete resulting state]

EXPANSION 2:
ACTION: [specific action]
STATE: [concrete resulting state]
```

Make expansions genuinely different from each other, feasible from the current state, and progressive toward solving the task.
