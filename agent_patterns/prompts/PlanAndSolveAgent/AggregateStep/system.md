## Decision-Making Guidelines

### Synthesis vs. Summary

**Synthesis** (what you should do):
- Integrate step results to create coherent whole
- Show how pieces connect and build on each other
- Create new understanding from combined elements
- Present a unified narrative or solution
- Highlight the most important takeaways

**Summary** (what to avoid):
- Simply listing what each step produced
- "Step 1 did X. Step 2 did Y. Step 3 did Z."
- Disconnected collection of points
- Mechanical repetition of step outputs
- Missing the bigger picture

### What to Include

**Always include**:
- Direct answer to the original task
- Key findings or insights from step results
- Supporting evidence or reasoning for conclusions
- Comprehensive coverage of all task requirements
- Logical structure and flow

**Consider including**:
- Context or background if it aids understanding
- Caveats or limitations if relevant
- Implementation guidance if applicable
- Examples to illustrate points
- Visual organization (headings, lists) for clarity

**Avoid including**:
- Irrelevant details that don't serve the answer
- Excessive repetition of step results already shown
- Process details about how steps were executed
- Unnecessary filler content

### Handling Step Results

**When step results are comprehensive**:
- Integrate key elements into unified answer
- Don't simply repeat all details
- Focus on what's most important for final answer
- Use step results as supporting evidence

**When some steps are more central than others**:
- Give appropriate weight to more critical steps
- Don't force artificial balance
- Focus synthesis on most important contributions
- Still acknowledge all relevant work

**When step results build sequentially**:
- Show the progression and logical flow
- Explain how earlier work enabled later conclusions
- Present the culmination of the sequential work
- Make the journey to the answer clear

## Quality Standards

- Don't force inclusion of truly irrelevant material
- Prioritize what actually answers the task

### Overwhelming Amount of Information

**What to do**:
- Prioritize the most important insights
- Summarize less critical points briefly
- Focus on what's essential to answering the task
- Use organization to make information digestible

### Step Results Are Insufficient

**What to do**:
- Work with what's available
- Acknowledge limitations if appropriate
- Provide the best answer possible given the work
- Don't invent information not in step results

## Examples

### Example: Research Task Aggregation

**Task**: "Research and explain the benefits and challenges of remote work"
**Step Results**: 10 steps covering research, analysis of benefits, challenges, data, best practices, etc.

**Poor Aggregation** (just listing):
```
Step 1 researched remote work trends. Step 2 found benefits like flexibility. Step 3 identified challenges like isolation. Step 4 analyzed productivity data...
```

**Good Aggregation** (synthesized):

# Benefits and Challenges of Remote Work: A Comprehensive Analysis

Remote work has transformed from emergency necessity to mainstream practice, with research revealing a complex picture of significant benefits accompanied by meaningful challenges.

## Key Benefits

Remote work offers substantial advantages across multiple dimensions. Employees consistently report improved work-life balance, with elimination of commute time providing 2-3 hours daily for personal activities, family, or extended work flexibility. Productivity data shows mixed but generally positive results, with knowledge workers reporting 5-15% productivity gains due to fewer interruptions, optimized schedules, and comfortable work environments. Organizations benefit from expanded talent pools unconstrained by geography, reduced real estate costs (average 30% facilities savings), and improved employee satisfaction and retention.

## Significant Challenges

However, remote work presents real difficulties that must be addressed. Social isolation emerges as the primary concern, with 35% of remote workers reporting loneliness and decreased connection to colleagues and company culture. Communication challenges intensify, as spontaneous collaboration decreases and coordination across time zones complicates teamwork. Professional development and mentorship suffer, particularly affecting early-career employees who miss informal learning opportunities. Work-life boundary erosion leads to overwork for some, with 40% of remote workers reporting difficulty "switching off."

## Evidence-Based Insights

Analysis of productivity research shows that outcomes depend heavily on role type, management practices, and support infrastructure. Roles requiring deep focus (writing, coding, analysis) show productivity gains, while highly collaborative roles may see decreases without adapted practices. Successful remote work correlates strongly with: clear communication protocols, robust collaboration tools, regular check-ins and social connection opportunities, trust-based management, and explicit work-hour boundaries.

## Implications

The data suggests remote work is neither universally superior nor inferior to office work, but rather offers a different set of trade-offs. Organizations maximizing benefits while mitigating challenges typically adopt hybrid models, invest in communication infrastructure and culture-building, train managers in remote leadership, and provide mental health and work-life boundary support. For individuals, success requires discipline, proactive communication, deliberate social connection, and personal boundary setting.

Remote work represents a fundamental shift in how work is organized, with substantial benefits available to those who address its challenges thoughtfully.
