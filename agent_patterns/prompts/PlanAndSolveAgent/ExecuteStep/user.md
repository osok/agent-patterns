# Plan & Solve Agent - Execute Step User Prompt

## Context

You are in the **Step Execution** phase of the Plan-and-Solve process. A plan has been created, and now you must execute one specific step from that plan, using context from previous steps to produce a clear result.

This is not about completing the entire taskâ€”it's about executing just this one step thoroughly and effectively.

## Original Task

{task}

## Current Step to Execute

{step}

## Previous Step Results

{previous_results}

## Your Assignment

Execute the current step and provide a clear result that:

1. **Fully accomplishes the step** - Completes what this specific step requests
2. **Uses previous context** - Builds on prior results where relevant
3. **Is comprehensive** - Provides sufficient depth and detail
4. **Is well-organized** - Presents results clearly and logically
5. **Prepares for next steps** - Produces output useful for subsequent work

## Execution Guidelines
