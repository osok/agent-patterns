# Plan & Solve Agent - Plan Step User Prompt

## Context

You are in the **Planning Phase** of the Plan-and-Solve process. Before any execution begins, you must analyze the task and create a comprehensive, step-by-step plan that will guide successful completion.

Your plan is the strategic roadmapâ€”it determines what gets done, in what order, and how steps build upon each other.

## Task to Plan

{task}

## Your Assignment

Create a detailed, sequential plan that:

1. **Is complete** - Covers all aspects needed to accomplish the task
2. **Is logical** - Steps flow in sensible order with proper dependencies
3. **Is specific** - Each step is clear, concrete, and actionable
4. **Is well-sequenced** - Foundation steps before execution, execution before refinement
5. **Enables success** - Following this plan would lead to high-quality task completion

## Planning Process

### Step 1: Understand the Task
- What is being asked?
- What should the final deliverable or outcome be?
- What constraints or requirements exist?
- What type of task is this (research, analysis, creative, technical, problem-solving)?

### Step 2: Identify Major Phases
- What are the main stages to complete this task?
- What foundational work comes first?
- What are the core execution phases?
- What validation or refinement is needed?

### Step 3: Break Down Into Specific Steps
- What concrete actions are needed in each phase?
- What information must be gathered or created?
- What analyses or decisions need to happen?
- How granular should steps be for clarity?

### Step 4: Sequence Logically
- Which steps provide inputs for later steps?
- What must be completed before something else can begin?
- Does this sequence flow naturally and build progressively?

### Step 5: Validate Completeness
- Does this plan cover everything needed?
- Is each step clear and actionable?
- Would following this plan lead to successful completion?
- Are there any gaps or missing steps?

## Output Format

Create a numbered, sequential plan:

```
1. [First step - what to do and why]
2. [Second step - building on step 1]
3. [Third step - next logical action]
4. [Fourth step - continuing progression]
...
```

**Requirements**:
- Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Clear, specific step descriptions (1-2 sentences each)
- Logical order respecting dependencies
- Actionable language with clear verbs
- Complete coverage of the task
- Appropriate granularity (typically 5-15 steps)

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your plan, verify:
- [ ] Steps are numbered sequentially with no gaps
- [ ] Plan covers all aspects needed to complete the task
- [ ] Steps flow in logical order
- [ ] Each step is specific and actionable
- [ ] Dependencies are respected (prerequisites come first)
- [ ] Steps are at appropriate granularity (not too broad or too detailed)
- [ ] Plan would lead to successful task completion
- [ ] Each step has clear purpose and value
- [ ] Typically 5-15 steps (adjust based on complexity)
