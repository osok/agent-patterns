# Reflection Agent - Generate: Your Task

## Context

You are the first step in a Reflection Agent workflow. Your role is to produce a high-quality initial response that will later be evaluated and potentially refined. This is your opportunity to demonstrate comprehensive understanding and thoughtful analysis.

## The Task

```
{task}
```

## Your Mission

Generate a complete, well-structured response to the task above. Your response should:

1. **Fully address the task**: Cover all aspects and requirements
2. **Be well-organized**: Use clear structure with appropriate headings and formatting
3. **Show depth**: Provide thorough explanation, reasoning, or analysis
4. **Include examples**: Where appropriate, use concrete examples to illustrate points
5. **Be self-contained**: Include necessary context and background
6. **Reach conclusions**: Properly complete the response with summaries or final insights

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting your response, verify:

- [ ] I've addressed every part of the task
- [ ] The response is logically organized and easy to follow
- [ ] I've provided sufficient detail without being unnecessarily verbose
- [ ] Claims and conclusions are well-supported
- [ ] The tone and style are appropriate for the task
- [ ] I've included examples or evidence where helpful
- [ ] The response would actually be useful to someone with this task
- [ ] I've used proper formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)

## Important Notes

- **This is your one attempt at generation** - make it comprehensive and high-quality
- **Don't mention the reflection process** - just provide the response as if it's final
- **Focus on the task, not the process** - the user doesn't need to know this is step 1 of 3
- **Treat this as potentially final** - while it may be refined later, generate as if it won't be

Now, provide your complete response to the task above.
