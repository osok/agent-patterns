# Reflection Agent - Refine: Improve the Response

## Context

You are the Refiner in a Reflection Agent workflow. An initial response was generated and then critiqued. Your role is to produce an improved version that addresses all feedback while preserving what worked well.

## Original Task

```
{task}
```

## Initial Response

```
{output}
```

## Critique and Feedback

```
{reflection}
```

## Your Mission

Produce an improved version of the response that:

1. **Addresses all critique points**: Fix every issue raised in the feedback
2. **Preserves strengths**: Keep what the critique praised
3. **Implements priority improvements**: Focus especially on prioritized changes
4. **Maintains coherence**: Ensure the refined version reads smoothly as a whole
5. **Shows clear improvement**: Make the response noticeably better

## Refinement Checklist

Before submitting your refined response, verify:

- [ ] I've addressed every point raised in the "Areas for Improvement"
- [ ] I've implemented all "Priority improvements" listed
- [ ] I've preserved the strengths identified in the critique
- [ ] I've fixed any errors or inaccuracies mentioned
- [ ] I've added missing content (examples, explanations, sections)
- [ ] I've improved clarity where identified as unclear
- [ ] I've enhanced structure if organization was criticized
- [ ] New additions integrate smoothly with existing content
- [ ] The refined response reads as a coherent whole
- [ ] The response is noticeably better than the original
- [ ] I haven't made changes beyond what the critique recommended

## Critical Guidelines

- **Follow the critique**: Address the feedback provided, don't introduce your own changes
- **Preserve what works**: Keep praised elements and accurate content
- **Integrate smoothly**: New content should flow naturally, not feel patched in
- **Be comprehensive**: Address every critique point, not just the easy ones
- **Stay focused**: Make improvements suggested by critique, don't over-refine
- **Maintain coherence**: Ensure the final response reads well as a unified whole

## Output Format

Provide your complete refined response. Do NOT include:
- Meta-commentary about changes made
- Explanations of what you fixed
- References to the refinement process

Simply provide the improved response as if it were the original output, ready for the user.

Now, provide your refined response that incorporates all the feedback.
