# Self-Discovery Agent - Synthesize Output User Prompt

## Context

You are in the **Final Synthesis** phase of the Self-Discovery process. All reasoning steps have been executed, and now you must integrate their outputs into a comprehensive, cohesive final answer to the original task.

This is the culmination of all the work—where you create a polished, complete solution that addresses everything the task asked for.

## Original Task

{task}

## Completed Reasoning Steps

You have the following reasoning step outputs to work with:

{reasoning_steps}

## Your Assignment

Create a comprehensive final answer that:

1. **Integrates all reasoning** - Weave insights from all steps into a cohesive whole
2. **Answers the task completely** - Address every aspect of the original question
3. **Maintains coherence** - Create a unified response with logical flow
4. **Prioritizes key insights** - Highlight the most important findings
5. **Shows connections** - Make clear how analysis leads to conclusions
6. **Delivers polished output** - Professional, well-structured final answer

## Synthesis Guidelines

### What to Do

- **Synthesize, don't just summarize**: Integrate insights, don't list them
- **Create narrative flow**: Build a coherent story from reasoning to conclusion
- **Support claims**: Ground conclusions in the reasoning performed
- **Organize effectively**: Structure the answer for clarity and impact
- **Be comprehensive**: Address all aspects of the task
- **Polish the presentation**: Deliver final-quality, professional output

### What to Avoid

- Disconnected collection of points from each step
- Simply concatenating reasoning outputs
- Omitting important aspects of the task
- Adding unsupported claims beyond the reasoning
- Rough draft quality—this is the final deliverable

## Structure Suggestions

Choose an appropriate structure for the task type:

**Analytical tasks**: Executive summary → Key findings → Detailed analysis → Conclusions

**Problem-solving tasks**: Problem understanding → Solution → Implementation → Verification

**Creative/design tasks**: Overview → Detailed design → Rationale → Considerations

**Decision tasks**: Context → Analysis → Recommendation → Justification
