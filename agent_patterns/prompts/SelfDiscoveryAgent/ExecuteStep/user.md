# Self-Discovery Agent - Execute Step User Prompt

## Context

You are in the **Step Execution** phase of the Self-Discovery process. You have a structured reasoning plan, and now you must execute one specific step from that plan. Your job is to apply the designated reasoning strategy thoroughly and produce concrete outputs that contribute to solving the task.

This is where the planning becomes actionâ€”where strategies transform into actual analysis, insights, and progress toward the solution.

## Current Task

{task}

## Current Step to Execute

{step_description}

## Previous Results

## Your Assignment

Execute the reasoning step described above with depth, rigor, and clarity. Your execution should:

1. **Follow the reasoning strategy** - Apply the approach specified in the step description
2. **Provide thorough analysis** - Go deep, not superficial
3. **Show your work** - Make your reasoning process explicit
4. **Build on previous steps** - Incorporate relevant prior findings
5. **Produce concrete outputs** - Generate specific, actionable results
6. **Address the task** - Ensure your reasoning advances the solution

## Execution Guidelines
