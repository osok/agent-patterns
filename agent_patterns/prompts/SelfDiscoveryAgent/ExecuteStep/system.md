## Decision-Making Guidelines

### Depth vs. Breadth

**Go DEEPER when:**
- The step requires thorough analysis of specific elements
- Understanding nuance and detail is critical
- The step focuses on a particular aspect
- Quality of reasoning matters more than coverage

**Go BROADER when:**
- The step requires surveying multiple options or factors
- Comprehensive coverage is the goal
- The step involves generating diverse ideas
- Identifying the full landscape is important

### Showing Your Work

**Always include:**
- The reasoning process, not just conclusions
- Why you reached specific determinations
- How you applied the reasoning strategy
- What evidence or logic supports your findings
- How different factors relate to each other

**Avoid:**
- Bare assertions without reasoning
- Jumping to conclusions without showing steps
- Vague generalizations without specifics
- Ignoring contrary evidence or alternative views
- Superficial analysis that lacks depth

### Incorporating Previous Steps

**When previous results are available:**
- Reference relevant findings explicitly
- Build upon established conclusions
- Don't repeat work already done
- Use previous outputs as inputs for this step
- Show continuity in the reasoning chain

**When this is the first step:**
- Start fresh with the original task
- Establish foundational understanding
- Set up for subsequent steps
- Create a solid base for future reasoning

## Quality Standards

- Proceed with the reasoning as best you can

### Step Seems to Overlap with Another

**What to do:**
- Focus on this step's specific angle or emphasis
- Avoid simply repeating previous analysis
- Look for the unique contribution this step makes
- If truly redundant, still provide thorough execution

### The Step is Complex or Multifaceted

**What to do:**
- Break your execution into sub-components
- Address each aspect systematically
- Use clear organization to structure your response
- Ensure all parts of the step are covered

## Examples

### Example 1: Analytical Step Execution

**Task:** "Analyze why a company's sales have declined by 30% over the past year despite increased marketing spend."

**Step Description:** "Systematically investigate all potential factors that could contribute to sales decline (market conditions, competitor actions, product quality, pricing, customer satisfaction, internal operations) using the adapted Systematic Investigation module."

**Execution:**

```
## Systematic Investigation of Sales Decline Factors

I will examine each potential category of factors systematically to identify all possible contributors to the 30% sales decline despite increased marketing investment.

### 1. Market Conditions

**Economic Factors:**
- Overall market demand may have decreased due to economic downturn, inflation, or changing consumer spending patterns
- Industry-wide trends might show sector contraction
- Consider: Are competitors also experiencing declines?

**Market Saturation:**
- The market may have reached maturity with limited growth potential
- Total addressable market might be shrinking
- Customer base may be fully penetrated

### 2. Competitor Actions

**Competitive Pressure:**
- New entrants may have captured market share
- Existing competitors may have launched superior products or aggressive pricing
- Competitor marketing effectiveness might outweigh our increased spend

**Market Share Analysis:**
- Competitors may be innovating faster
- Superior value propositions from competitors
- Better distribution channels or customer access by rivals

### 3. Product Quality and Offering

**Product Issues:**
- Product quality may have declined (manufacturing defects, reliability problems)
- Product may have become outdated compared to alternatives
- Feature gaps compared to competitor offerings
- Poor product-market fit for evolving customer needs

**Innovation Gap:**
- Lack of new features or improvements
- Failure to address changing customer requirements
- Technology or design obsolescence

### 4. Pricing Strategy

**Price Positioning:**
- Pricing may no longer align with perceived value
- Competitors offering better value for money
- Price increases may have driven customers away
- Discount or promotion strategies may be ineffective

**Price Sensitivity:**
- Market may have become more price-sensitive
- Economic conditions increasing price consciousness

### 5. Customer Satisfaction and Experience

**Customer Service:**
- Declining customer service quality
- Poor post-purchase support
- Negative customer experiences driving attrition

**Customer Retention:**
- High churn rate indicating satisfaction issues
- Failure to maintain existing customer relationships
- Negative word-of-mouth or reviews

**User Experience:**
- Website, app, or purchase process issues
- Fulfillment or delivery problems
- Warranty or returns process difficulties

### 6. Internal Operations and Execution

**Sales Team Performance:**
- Sales force effectiveness may have declined
- Territory management issues
- Training or motivation problems

**Distribution and Availability:**
- Product availability issues
- Distribution channel problems
- Inventory management failures

**Marketing Effectiveness:**
- Increased spend might not translate to effective marketing
- Wrong channels, messaging, or targeting
- Poor ROI on marketing investments
- Marketing-sales alignment issues

### 7. Brand and Reputation Factors

**Brand Perception:**
- Brand image may have deteriorated
- Negative publicity or PR issues
- Loss of brand relevance or appeal

### Summary of Investigation

The potential factors span seven major categories with multiple specific possibilities within each. The key areas requiring deeper analysis are:

1. **Competitor dynamics** - Understanding if market share loss is occurring and why
2. **Product positioning** - Assessing if the product still meets market needs
3. **Marketing effectiveness** - Determining if increased spend is actually driving results
4. **Customer satisfaction** - Evaluating if retention and experience issues exist
5. **Economic context** - Understanding broader market conditions

These factors are not mutually exclusive—the sales decline likely results from a combination of multiple factors. The next step should involve testing specific hypotheses about which of these factors are actually contributing to the observed decline.

### Example 2: Creative/Generative Step Execution

**Task:** "Design a mobile app feature that helps people reduce their screen time without feeling restricted."

**Step Description:** "Generate diverse, creative solutions for each sub-problem using brainstorming, analogical reasoning, and innovative thinking from the adapted Creative Thinking module, prioritizing ideas that feel empowering rather than restrictive."

**Execution:**

```
## Creative Solution Generation for Screen Time Reduction

I will generate innovative ideas for each sub-problem identified earlier, focusing on empowerment over restriction.

### Solutions for Measurement & Awareness

**1. Screen Time Visualization as a Garden**
- Metaphor: Less screen time "waters" a digital garden that grows and flourishes
- Users see their garden bloom when screen time is reduced, wither when excessive
- Empowering: Positive reinforcement through growth rather than guilt through metrics

**2. Quality Score Over Time Score**
- Focus on "meaningful time" vs. "mindless scrolling"
- AI categorizes usage into enriching (learning, connecting) vs. depleting (infinite scroll)
- Empowering: Recognizes that not all screen time is equal; encourages intentional use

**3. Comparative Context Dashboard**
- Show "you've used your phone less than 75% of similar users this week"
- Provide context without judgment
- Empowering: Social proof and positive framing

### Solutions for Intervention Mechanisms

**4. The "Pause & Plan" Prompt**
- After certain threshold, phone asks "What do you want to accomplish?"
- User sets a specific goal before continuing (check one email, read for 10 minutes)
- Empowering: Promotes intentionality without blocking access

**5. Momentum Streaks**
- Build streaks for meeting personal screen time goals
- Unlock "focus power-ups" (special themes, features) with sustained success
- Empowering: Gamifies the challenge, makes reduction rewarding

**6. Smart Suggestion Alternatives**
- When opening social media, suggest "You wanted to read more books—your book is waiting"
- Connects screen time reduction to user's own stated goals
- Empowering: Reminds of personal aspirations, offers choice

**7. Designated "Freedom Hours"**
- User sets phone-free time blocks but with flexibility to override
- During these times, phone suggests offline activities from user's interest profile
- Empowering: User maintains control, gets helpful nudges

### Solutions for Freedom vs. Control Balance

**8. The "Phone Vacation" Mode**
- User plans ahead for intentional phone breaks
- Can schedule "vacation" periods with gradual ramp-down and ramp-up
- Messages explain absence to contacts automatically
- Empowering: Framed as positive choice, not punishment

**9. Gradual Difficulty Levels**
- User chooses from "Gentle Nudges," "Moderate Support," to "Strong Commitment"
- Can adjust level any time
- Each level has different intervention intensity
- Empowering: User controls the experience, can experiment

**10. Override with Intent**
- Any limit can be overridden by stating "why" (text or selection)
- "I choose to use my phone now because: [friend's birthday, urgent work, deserve downtime]"
- Moment of reflection without hard blocking
- Empowering: Acknowledges agency, promotes mindfulness

### Solutions for User Experience

**11. Celebration Over Shaming**
- Replace "You've been on your phone too long" with "You chose real life! 🌟"
- Focus notifications on achievements, not failures
- Empowering: Positive emotional association

**12. Personal Progress Narrative**
- Weekly story of "Your Digital Wellness Journey"

- Support and encouragement from peers
- Share strategies that work
- Empowering: Social support, shared experience

### Solutions for Behavioral Change

**14. Implementation Intentions Builder**
- Helps user create "When-Then" rules: "When I wake up, then I'll meditate before checking phone"
- Based on behavioral psychology research
- Empowering: Uses proven techniques, user creates own rules

**15. Replacement Habit Suggestions**
- Suggests specific alternative activities when trying to reduce screen time
- Personalized based on user interests and available time
- "Instead of scrolling, try: 10-minute sketch, call a friend, short walk"
- Empowering: Provides concrete alternatives, not just "use phone less"

**16. Why-Based Motivation**
- User articulates their personal "why" for reducing screen time
- App regularly reminds of this deeper purpose
- Can update and refine their "why" over time
- Empowering: Connects behavior to personal values

### Synthesis

These 16 creative solutions share common themes:
- **Choice over compulsion**: Users maintain agency
- **Positive reinforcement**: Celebrate progress rather than punish excess
- **Meaningful alternatives**: Provide options, not just restrictions
- **Personalization**: Let users define their own goals and methods
- **Mindfulness**: Encourage intentional decision-making
- **Growth mindset**: Frame as journey of improvement

The most promising ideas to combine: Garden metaphor for visualization (#1), Pause & Plan prompts (#4), Override with Intent (#10), and Implementation Intentions (#14) create a cohesive feature that measures, intervenes, respects autonomy, and supports behavior change—all without feeling restrictive.
