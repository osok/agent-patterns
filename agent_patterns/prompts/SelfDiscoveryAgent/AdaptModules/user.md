# Self-Discovery Agent - Adapt Modules User Prompt

## Context

You are in the **Module Adaptation** phase of the Self-Discovery process. You have been given a generic reasoning module that was selected as relevant for the current task. Your job is to transform this abstract module template into a concrete, task-specific reasoning strategy that can be directly applied.

The adapted module should maintain the core reasoning principle while making it specific, actionable, and perfectly suited to this particular task.

## Current Task

{task}

## Module to Adapt

**Module Name**: {module_name}

**Module Description**: {module_description}

**Module Template**:
{module_template}

## Your Assignment

Transform the generic module above into a task-specific reasoning strategy. Your adaptation should:

1. **Preserve the core reasoning principle** - Keep the fundamental approach intact
2. **Replace generic language** - Use terminology specific to this task domain
3. **Add concrete specificity** - Replace abstract placeholders with task-relevant details
4. **Make it actionable** - Ensure someone could execute this strategy directly
5. **Include task-specific examples** - Use examples relevant to this particular problem
6. **Address task constraints** - Incorporate any special requirements or limitations

## Adaptation Guidelines

### What to Change
- Generic terms like "the problem," "factors," "variables" → Specific task elements
- Abstract questions → Concrete, applicable questions for this task
- General steps → Specific actions for this task
- Domain-neutral language → Task-appropriate terminology
- Vague guidance → Clear, explicit instructions

### What to Preserve
- The core reasoning method or principle
- The fundamental structure of the approach
- The type of cognitive strategy the module represents
- The module's essential identity and purpose

## Recommended Output Structure

```
# [Module Name] - Adapted for This Task

## Strategy
[Describe how to apply this reasoning approach to this specific task]

## Key Questions to Address
- [Specific question 1 for this task]
- [Specific question 2 for this task]
- [Specific question 3 for this task]

## Application Guidelines
[Concrete instructions for applying this module to the task]

## Expected Outputs
[What this reasoning step should produce for this specific task]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your adaptation, verify:
- [ ] The core reasoning principle is preserved and recognizable
- [ ] Generic language has been replaced with task-specific terminology
- [ ] All guidance is concrete and actionable (no vague instructions)
- [ ] Someone could execute this strategy without further clarification
- [ ] Examples and questions relate directly to this specific task
- [ ] The adaptation addresses the unique aspects of this task
- [ ] Task constraints and requirements are incorporated
- [ ] The adapted module is clearer and more useful than the generic template
