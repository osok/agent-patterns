# STORM Agent - Generate Outline User Prompt

## Context

You are in the **Outline Creation** phase of the STORM research process. Before any detailed research or writing begins, you must create a comprehensive, hierarchical outline that will structure the entire research report.

Your outline is the blueprint for everything that follows. It determines what sections will be written, in what order, and how they relate to each other.

## Topic

{topic}

## Your Assignment

Create a comprehensive outline for a research report on this topic that:

1. **Covers the topic comprehensively** - Includes all major aspects and dimensions
2. **Is logically organized** - Sections flow in a sensible order
3. **Has clear hierarchy** - Proper sections and subsections structure
4. **Is well-balanced** - Appropriate scope and granularity
5. **Guides the reader** - Structure builds understanding progressively

## Outline Development Process

### Step 1: Understand the Topic
- What are the main dimensions or aspects of this topic?
- What would a comprehensive report need to cover?
- Who is the audience and what do they need to know?

### Step 2: Identify Major Sections
- What are 4-8 major sections needed for comprehensive coverage?
- How should these sections be ordered logically?
- What foundational sections vs. advanced sections are needed?

### Step 3: Define Subsections
- What 2-5 subsections does each major section need?
- Are subsections focused and distinct?
- Do subsections collectively cover the section's scope?

### Step 4: Validate Structure
- Does this outline cover the topic comprehensively?
- Is the organization logical and reader-friendly?
- Does information build progressively?
- Are all sections clearly defined and purposeful?

## Output Format

Respond using this EXACT format:

```
SECTION: [Section Title]
SUBSECTION: [Subsection Title]
SUBSECTION: [Subsection Title]

SECTION: [Section Title]
SUBSECTION: [Subsection Title]
SUBSECTION: [Subsection Title]
SUBSECTION: [Subsection Title]

SECTION: [Section Title]
SUBSECTION: [Subsection Title]
```

**Requirements**:
- Start each major section with "SECTION: " followed by title
- List subsections under each section with "SUBSECTION: " prefix
- Separate major sections with one blank line
- No blank lines between subsections within a section
- No numbering in titles
- No additional text or explanations

## Structural Guidelines

**Typical report structure**:
- **Introduction/Overview** - Introduce topic, context, significance
- **Background/Foundations** - Establish basic concepts and context
- **Core Content Sections** (3-5 sections) - Main body of knowledge
- **Analysis/Evaluation** - Examine challenges, benefits, implications
- **Future Directions** - Emerging trends, opportunities
- **Conclusion** - Synthesis and key takeaways

**Section guidelines**:
- 4-8 major sections typically
- Each section has 2-5 subsections typically
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Logical ordering (foundation → detail → analysis → future)
