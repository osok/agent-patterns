# PyPI Publishing - Ready to Go! ✅

## Current Status

Your PyPI setup is **excellent** and follows all 2025 best practices! Here's what you have:

✅ **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/pypi.yaml`) - Properly configured
✅ **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** - Modern, secure, token-free publishing
✅ **Separate build/publish jobs** - Best practice for reliability
✅ **TestPyPI support** - For safe testing before production
✅ **Package configuration** (`pyproject.toml`) - Complete and correct
✅ **MANIFEST.in** - Includes all necessary files including prompts

## What You Need to Do

Since you mentioned having a `PYPI_API_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets, but your workflow uses Trusted Publishing (which is better!), you have two options:

### Option 1: Use Trusted Publishing (Recommended) ⭐

This is **more secure** and what your workflow is already configured for. No API tokens needed!

#### Steps to Complete:

### 1. Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing

Go to PyPI and set up trusted publishing for your project:

**URL**: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/

Click **"Add a new pending publisher"** and fill in:

```
PyPI Project Name:  agent-patterns
Owner:              osok
Repository name:    agent-patterns
Workflow name:      pypi.yaml
Environment name:   pypi
```

Click **"Add"**

> **Note**: Since you said the project is "pending" on PyPI, this step creates a "pending publisher" that will become active when you first publish.

### 2. Configure GitHub Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Add protection to your `pypi` environment:

1. Go to: https://github.com/osok/agent-patterns/settings/environments
2. Click **"New environment"** (or edit existing `pypi` environment)
3. Environment name: `pypi`
4. Add protection rules (optional):
   - ✅ Required reviewers (add yourself or team members)
   - ✅ Wait timer (0 minutes is fine)
   - ✅ Deployment branches: Only allow releases and protected branches

### 3. Publish Your First Release

When you're ready to publish:

1. **Go to GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/osok/agent-patterns/releases
2. Click **"Draft a new release"**
3. Click **"Choose a tag"** → Type: `v0.2.0` → Click **"Create new tag: v0.2.0 on publish"**
4. **Release title**: `v0.2.0`
5. **Description**: Copy the release notes from PUBLISHING.md or write your own
6. Click **"Publish release"**

The GitHub Action will automatically:
- ✅ Build your package
- ✅ Run quality checks
- ✅ Publish to PyPI using trusted publishing
- ✅ Generate digital attestations (automatic with trusted publishing)

### 4. Verify Publication

After the workflow completes (2-3 minutes):

1. Check PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/agent-patterns/
2. Test installation:
   ```bash
   pip install agent-patterns
   ```
3. Verify it works:
   ```bash
   python -c "from agent_patterns.patterns import ReActAgent; print('Success!')"
   ```

### Option 2: Use API Token (Alternative)

If you prefer to use your existing `PYPI_API_TOKEN`, you need to modify the workflow.

**Current workflow uses**: Trusted Publishing (OIDC)
**To use token instead**: Need to modify `.github/workflows/pypi.yaml`

Let me know if you want to use this method, and I'll update the workflow file.

## Testing Before Production (Highly Recommended)

Before publishing to production PyPI, test with TestPyPI:

### 1. Configure TestPyPI Trusted Publishing

**URL**: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/

Add pending publisher with same details:
```
PyPI Project Name:  agent-patterns
Owner:              osok
Repository name:    agent-patterns
Workflow name:      pypi.yaml
Environment name:   testpypi
```

### 2. Manually Trigger Workflow

1. Go to: https://github.com/osok/agent-patterns/actions/workflows/pypi.yaml
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

This will publish to **TestPyPI only** (not production PyPI).

### 3. Test the TestPyPI Package

```bash
# Install from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ agent-patterns

# Test it works
python -c "from agent_patterns.patterns import ReActAgent; print('Success!')"
```

> **Note**: `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/` is needed because dependencies (langgraph, langchain) are on production PyPI.

## What About Your PYPI_API_TOKEN Secret?

You mentioned having `PYPI_API_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets, but your workflow doesn't use it (it uses trusted publishing instead, which is better).

**You can:**
- ✅ **Leave it there** - It's not being used but doesn't hurt
- ✅ **Remove it** - Not needed for trusted publishing
- ✅ **Keep it as backup** - In case you ever need manual publishing

To use the token, you'd need to modify the workflow, but I **strongly recommend using trusted publishing** (your current setup).

## Comparison: Trusted Publishing vs API Token

| Feature | Trusted Publishing (Current) | API Token |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Security | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ No long-lived secrets | ⭐⭐⭐ Token can be leaked |
| Setup | One-time PyPI config | Need to manage tokens |
| Rotation | Automatic | Manual rotation needed |
| Attestations | ✅ Automatic digital signatures | ❌ Not available |
| PyPI Recommendation | ✅ Recommended | Legacy method |

**Your workflow is already using the best method!**

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need to do anything with my PYPI_API_TOKEN secret?**
A: No, your workflow doesn't use it. Trusted publishing is better and already configured.

**Q: What's the difference between your workflow directory name?**
A: You mentioned `.github/webflows` but it should be `.github/workflows` (which is what you have correctly).

**Q: Can I publish manually instead of using GitHub Actions?**
A: Yes, see PUBLISHING.md "Method 2: Manual Publishing" section.

**Q: What if the package name is already taken on PyPI?**
A: You'll get an error during publishing. Choose a different name in `pyproject.toml`.

**You're all set!** Your configuration is excellent. Just complete the PyPI trusted publishing setup and create a release.
