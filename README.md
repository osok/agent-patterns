### Integrations

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Connect agents to standardized tool providers using Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

## Architecture

The library follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Modular Base Classes**: Abstract base classes define common agent operations and Graph structures
2. **Externalized Configuration & Prompts**: Templates and parameters stored outside core code
3. **Developer Clarity**: Clear documentation of responsibilities and extension points
4. **Testability & Extensibility**: Separated components for easy testing and maintenance

For a comprehensive overview of the architecture, see the [Design Documentation](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Design.html).

## Integration Descriptions

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration allows agents to connect with standardized tool providers following Anthropic's open protocol. This integration enables agents to access a wide ecosystem of tools without having to implement custom integrations for each one.

Key features:
- Connect to any MCP-compatible server
- Automatic tool discovery and execution
- Support for multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- Standardized interface for tool providers
- Custom tool provider implementation support

For detailed documentation, see:
- [Tool Provider API Documentation](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tool%20Provider%20API%20Documentation.html)
- [MCP Tool Integration Tutorial](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MCP%20Tool%20Integration%20Tutorial.html)
- [Agent Tools Design](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Agent%20Tools%20Design.html)

### Memory Systems

All agent patterns include comprehensive memory capabilities that allow agents to store and retrieve information across interactions. The memory system enables agents to maintain context, learn from past interactions, and provide personalized responses.

Key features:
- **Multiple Memory Types**: Semantic (facts), Episodic (experiences), and Procedural (patterns)
- **Flexible Persistence**: In-memory, file system, and vector store backends
- **Customizable Retrieval**: Query-based memory retrieval with filtering options
- **Seamless Integration**: Works across all agent patterns with consistent API

- [Memory Integration Tutorial](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Memory%20Integration%20Tutorial.html)

- [Memory and MCP Integration](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory_and_mcp_integration.html)

## Creating New Patterns

1. Subclass `BaseAgent` or `MultiAgentBase`
2. Define `build_graph()` with your LangGraph nodes and transitions
3. Implement node functions for each step
4. Add prompts in `prompts/<YourPatternClass>/`
5. Create example scripts and tests

For more guidance on next steps and development, see [Next Steps](https://agent-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Next%20Steps.html).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new pattern:

## Common Issues

### Package Installation
When installing the package via pip, you might encounter the following issues:

1. **Import Errors**: The package structure is different when installed via pip vs running from source:
   - Source code: `from src.agent_patterns...`
   - Installed package: `from agent_patterns...`

2. **Prompt Directory Path**: The examples might be looking for prompts in the wrong location:
   - Source code: `project_root / "src" / "agent_patterns" / "prompts"`
   - Installed package: `project_root / "agent_patterns" / "prompts"`

3. **Missing Agents in __init__.py**: Some agent classes might not be included in the package's `__init__.py` files.

4. **Running Examples**: All examples must be run from the project root directory, not from within the examples directory:
   ```bash
   # Correct
   python examples/react/simple_example.py
   
   # Incorrect
   cd examples && python react/simple_example.py
   ```

### Fixing the Issues

We provide a helper script to automatically fix import paths and prompt directory issues:

```bash
# Run from the repository root
python tools/fix_imports.py
```

If you encounter import errors after installing the package, you may need to update the affected `__init__.py` files to include the missing classes.
